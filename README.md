# 1D Sod Shock Tube SPH Solver
A C++ code that solves Euler's equations using the method of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics with optional artificial viscosity. The equations are integrated using a sympletic leapfrog integration scheme. The intial conditions are that of the Sod Shock Tube. More information on the method and results are visible on the report located [here](Shock_Tube_Report.pdf).
